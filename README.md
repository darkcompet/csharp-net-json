# Json for C# Core

This is based on Json in .NET Core, provide Json conversion for apps.

Note that, even though it is based on Core, but some framework (for eg,. Unity,...)
does work well with it since some restriction on that framework.
In that case, we should use that framework-based Json instead (for eg,. csharp-unity-json,...).


## Quick Start

- Just include it into project by add as git-submodule.
	
	```bash
	# Tool.Compet.JsonNet
	git submodule add https://github.com/darkcompet/csharp-core-json.git
	```
